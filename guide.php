				<h3>How to use this site</h3>
				<p>The site provides teachers, parents, students, policymakers and indeed anyone with an interest in national A-Level, AS-Level and GCSE results with analysis of entries and attainment between 2014 and 2018. Data is provided for England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the UK as whole.</p>
				<h5>What each page shows</h5>
				<p>Two charts are presented on each page for a subject, the upper chart showing the number of entries and the lower chart showing attainment. The text to the right of the chart provides a summary of the data for the UK as whole and, where applicable, provides guidance and caveats about interpretation.</p>
				<p>Each chart can be downloaded as a picture file (JPG or PNG) and the underlying data for each chart can also be downloaded. We hope that users of the site will share these files via blogposts and social media. Use the menu icon in the top right of each chart to do so.</p>
				<h5>Drop-down controls</h5>
				<p>The contents of the charts can be changed using the drop-downs above them. Note that the drop-down above the upper chart, which shows number of entries, also controls the lower chart, which shows attainment.</p>
				<p>For A-Levels and AS-Levels, you can choose to display data for England, Wales, Northern Ireland or the UK as whole. On the lower chart, you can choose to display attainment for boys, girls or all pupils for the selected country.</p>
				<p>For GCSEs, you can <strong>either</strong> choose to display data for a country <strong>or</strong> for an age cohort, but not both. In other words, choosing to display 16 year olds will return data for all 16 year olds in the UK. On the lower chart, you can choose to display attainment for boys, girls or all pupils for <strong>either</strong> the selected country <strong>or</strong> the selected age cohort.</p>
				<h3>General guidance on interpretation</h3>
				<h5>Policy and qualification reforms</h5>
				<p>Significant reforms to qualifications and accountability policies have been taking place in each country since 2014 and these affect not only comparability between the three home nations but also the year-on-year comparability of the data for each country.</p>
				<h5 id='reform_date'>Reform date</h5>
				<p>For each subject or group of subjects, a reform date is given on the right hand side of the page.</p>
				<p>Reform dates relates to the date when most students in a given home nation will be entered reformed versions of the qualifications. Some students may enter qualifications offered by an exam board in a home nation other than the one in which they live.</p>
				<p>The years in which subjects were reformed at A-Level, AS-Level and GCSE in each country are summarised in the technical document <a href='/about.php'>available on the About page</a>.</p>

				<h6>Facilitating subjects</h6>
				<p>Facilitating subjects are the A-Levels which the Russell Group of universities believe leave open a wide range of study options. These are: <strong>English literature</strong>; <strong>maths and further maths</strong>; <strong>biology</strong>; <strong>chemistry</strong>; <strong>physics</strong>; <strong>modern and classical languages</strong>; <strong>geography</strong>; and <strong>history</strong>.</p>
				<p><img src='/img/facilFlagImgPink.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This is a facilitating subject'> Facilitating subjects are identified on A-Level and AS-Level pages by this symbol.</p>
				<p><img src='/img/facilFlagImgGrey.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This is not a facilitating subject'> Subjects not considered to be facilitating subjects are identified on A-Level and AS-Level pages by this symbol.</p>
				<h6>Progress 8</h6>
				<p>Progress 8 was introduced as the headline measure used in secondary school performance tables in England in 2016. It is based on attainment in <strong>English/English literature</strong>; <strong>maths</strong>; <strong>three EBacc subjects</strong> (see below); and <strong>any three other subjects</strong>. It has led to an increase in take-up of EBacc subjects.</p>
				<p>Results in maths and English carry greater weight in the calculation of Progress 8 than other subjects: maths results are double-weighted, as are the higher of an entrant's English language and English literature results, so long as both subjects have been taken.</p>
				<p><img src='/img/p8dblFlagImgPink.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This subject is double-counted in Progress 8 calculations (England only)'> Subjects that are double-weighted in Progress 8 are identified on GCSE pages by this symbol.</p>
				<p><img src='/img/p8dblFlagImgGrey.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This subject is not double-counted in Progress 8 calculations (England only)'> Subjects that are not double-weighted in Progress 8 are identified on GCSE pages by this symbol.</p>
				<h6>EBacc</h6>
				<p>The English Baccalaureate (EBacc) is a performance indicator used in secondary school performance tables in England. It is based on attainment in English/English literature, mathematics, two science subjects (including computing), a humanity (history or geography) and a modern or classical foreign language (the most common of which are French, German and Spanish).</p>
				<p><img src='/img/ebaccFlagImgPink.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This subject counts in the English Baccalaureate (England only)'> EBacc subjects are identified on GCSE pages by this symbol</p>
				<p><img src='/img/ebaccFlagImgGrey.png' class='tooltipped' data-position="top" data-tooltip='This subject does not count in the English Baccalaureate (England only)'> Non-EBacc subjects are identified on GCSE pages by this symbol.</p>
				<p>More detailed guidance about interpreting the data for particular subjects is included in the technical document <a href='/about.php'>available on the About page</a>. These notes are also displayed in the text to the right of the charts on the microsite.</p>
				<h5>Interpreting entry numbers</h5>
				<p>Entry numbers are affected by changes in the size of the population as well as changing popularity. Each nation has policies to encourage take-up of particular qualifications. In addition, special interest groups and royal societies have various initiatives to increase take-up of subjects, e.g. STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths).</p>
				<h5>Interpreting attainment</h5>
				<p>In England, reformed GCSEs graded 9-1 began to replace legacy GCSEs graded A*-G in 2017. To provide comparable trend data, data on key grades is presented.</p>
				<p>Broadly speaking, reformed grades 9-7 correspond to legacy grades A*-A, grades 9-4 correspond to A*-C and 9-1 correspond to A*-G.</p>
				<p>Consequently, the three lines on the chart showing GCSE attainment represent percentages of pupils achieving grade A/7 (or above), grade C/4 (or above) and grade G/1 (or above).</p>
