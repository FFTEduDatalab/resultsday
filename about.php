				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>This microsite provides analysis of national GCSE and A-Level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2014 to 2018. The data has been sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications. The <a href="#nuffield">Nuffield Foundation</a> has provided funding for the development of the site.</p>

				<p>There has been substantial policy change at both Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 during this time. All three nations have reviewed their curriculum and adopted different approaches in response. These changes, summarised below, affect comparisons between the three nations and comparisons over time within each nation.</p>
				<h5 id='2018'>2018 data</h5>
				<p>Data for 2018 is not yet available, but will be added to the site once it becomes available. A-Level and AS-Level data will be available at <strong>9.30am on Thursday 16 August</strong> and GCSE data will be available at <strong>9.30 on Thursday 23 August</strong>.</p>
				<h3>Technical guidance</h3>
				A document, setting out in detail the data on which this site is based, together with key information needed to interpret data presented <a href='/technical_documentation.pdf'>can be found here</a> [PDF].
				<h3>The data</h3>
				<p>The data for the microsite is sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), a membership organisation for the eight largest awarding organisations in the UK.</p>

				<p>Each year, JCQ collates the aggregate results of A-Levels and GCSEs delivered by its members and publishes them on its website. UK-wide results are published for male and female students, and all students.</p>

				<p>The published data is provisional. Results may subsequently change due to appeals and remarks. Comparisons to previous years are similarly based on provisional results.</p>

				<h3>FAQ</h3>
				<h6>Which qualifications feature in the data?</h6>
				<p>Subjects featured in the data presented on this site are A-Levels, AS-Levels, full course GCSEs and full course vocational GCSEs awarded by one of the award bodies that make up JCQ. Qualifications such as IGCSEs (international GCSEs) do not therefore feature in the data.</p>
				<h6>Why doesn’t Scotland feature in the data?</h6>
				<p>The education systems of England, Wales and Northern Ireland are broadly similar, with students take a range of qualifications and public examinations, primarily GCSEs, at age 16. Scotland has a distinct system with students typically taking National 5 qualifications, which are considered to be equivalent to GCSEs, at age 16. Results are not available from JCQ.</p>

				<h3 id='nuffield'>The Nuffield Foundation</h3>
				<p>The Nuffield Foundation funds research, analysis, and student programmes that advance educational opportunity and social well-being across the United Kingdom. It is an independent charitable trust established in 1943 by William Morris, Lord Nuffield, the founder of Morris Motors.</p>

				<p>The Foundation works to improve people’s lives, and their ability to participate in society, by understanding the social and economic factors that affect their chances in life. The research it funds aims to improve the design and operation of social policy, particularly in Education, Welfare, and Justice.</p>

				<p>The Foundation’s student programmes – Nuffield Research Placements and Q-Step – provide opportunities for individual students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to develop their skills and confidence in quantitative and scientific methods.</p>

				<p>The Nuffield Foundation has funded this project, but the collation and interpretation of the data has been the responsibility of the FFT Education Datalab team. <a href='https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org' target="_blank">www.nuffieldfoundation.org</a> | <a href='https://www.twitter.com/NuffieldFound' target="_blank">@NuffieldFound</a></p>
