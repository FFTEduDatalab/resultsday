				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>This microsite provides analysis of national GCSE and A-Level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2014 to 2018. The data has been sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications. The <a href="#nuffield">Nuffield Foundation</a> has provided funding for the development of the site.</p>

				<p>There has been substantial policy change at both Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 during this time. All three nations have reviewed their curriculum and adopted different approaches in response. These changes affect comparisons between the three nations and comparisons over time within each nation, and this site is designed to make this .</p>
				<h5 id='2018'>2018 data</h5>
				<p>Data for 2018 will be added to the site at <strong>9.30am on Thursday 16 August 2018</strong> for A-Levels and AS-Levels, and at <strong>9.30 on Thursday 23 August 2018</strong> for GCSEs.</p>

				<p>Exam entry and attainment data is sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), a membership organisation for the eight largest awarding organisations in the UK.</p>

				<h3 id='nuffield'>The Nuffield Foundation</h3>
				<p>The Nuffield Foundation funds research, analysis, and student programmes that advance educational opportunity and social well-being across the United Kingdom. It is an independent charitable trust established in 1943 by William Morris, Lord Nuffield, the founder of Morris Motors.</p>

				<p>The Foundation works to improve people’s lives, and their ability to participate in society, by understanding the social and economic factors that affect their chances in life. The research it funds aims to improve the design and operation of social policy, particularly in Education, Welfare, and Justice.</p>

				<p>The Foundation’s student programmes – Nuffield Research Placements and Q-Step – provide opportunities for individual students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to develop their skills and confidence in quantitative and scientific methods.</p>

				<p>The Nuffield Foundation has funded this project, but the collation and interpretation of the data has been the responsibility of the FFT Education Datalab team. <a href='https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org' target="_blank">www.nuffieldfoundation.org</a> | <a href='https://www.twitter.com/NuffieldFound' target="_blank">@NuffieldFound</a></p>
