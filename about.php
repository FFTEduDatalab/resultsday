				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>This microsite provides analysis of national GCSE and A-Level results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2014 to 2018. The data has been sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications. The <a href="#nuffield">Nuffield Foundation</a> has provided funding for the development of the site.</p>

				<p>There has been substantial policy change at both Key Stage 4 and Key Stage 5 during this time. All three nations have reviewed their curriculum and adopted different approaches in response. These changes, summarised below, affect comparisons between the three nations and comparisons over time within each nation.</p>

				<h3>The data</h3>
				<p>The data for the microsite is sourced from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), a membership organisation for the eight largest awarding organisations in the UK.</p>

				<p>Each year, JCQ collates the aggregate results of A-Levels and GCSEs delivered by its members and publishes them on its website. UK-wide results are published for male and female students, and all students.</p>

				<p>The published data is provisional. Results may subsequently change due to appeals and remarks. Comparisons to previous years are similarly based on provisional results.</p>

				<p>Sources are given below:</p>
