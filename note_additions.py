"In England, entries in English language increased markedly in 2017 <a href='https://ffteducationdatalab.org.uk/2017/08/gcse-results-day-2017-the-key-trends-in-entries-and-results/'>as the alternative IGCSE English language qualification ceased to count in school league tables</a>."

"In England, entries in English language increased markedly in 2017 for two reasons. Firstly, <a href='https://ffteducationdatalab.org.uk/2017/08/gcse-results-day-2017-the-key-trends-in-entries-and-results/'>the alternative IGCSE English literature qualification ceased to count in school league tables. Secondly, for the first time in 2017, to count fully in Progress 8, the secondary school accountability measure, pupils had to take separate English language and English literature GCSEs.</a>."

ENLA, WA
"In Wales, a reformed English language GCSE was first available in 2017, and would not therefore have been accessible to Year 10 students the previous year. This is believed to have had the effect of inflating the number of Year 11 entries in 2017, with entries in 2018 expected to return to a lower level."

ENLI, WA
"In Wales, in 2017, a substantial proportion of pupils had previously entered English literature in Year 10. A move away from this is expected to increase entries in 2018."

MATH, WA
"In Wales, a reformed maths GCSE was first available in 2017, and would not therefore have been accessible to Year 10 students the previous year. This is believed to have had the effect of inflating the number of Year 11 entries in 2017, with entries in 2018 expected to return to a lower level."

MATN, WA
"The subject would also not have been available to Year 10 students the previous year. This is believed to have had the effect of inflating the number of Year 11 entries in 2017, with entries in 2018 expected to be lower."

SCIE, EN/WA
"In England and Wales, a combined, double award science GCSE replaces separate science and additional science GCSEs in 2018. Entry numbers are shown doubled, reflecting this change."

BIOL, EN/WA
CHEM, EN/WA
PHYS, EN/WA
"The end of science and additional science GCSEs in 2017 is believed to have prompted a number of schools to have reconsidered their science entry choices, impacting on the number of entries in the single sciences."

*, WA/15
"In Wales, entry numbers in all subjects have been affected by a change in school performance measures. From summer 2019, pupils' first entries, rather than best entries will be counted. This has had the effect of disincentivising Year 10 entries in 2018."

"In England, since 2015, pupils who achieved a grade D (pre-2017)/grade 3 (2017 onwards) have been required to resit English language GCSE as part of their post-16 studies."

"New GCSEs in food and hygiene are reported separately, where previously food technology was reported within design and technology."

"Single award science remains available in Northern Ireland."

# AS-Level

"In England, in subjects that have been reformed, AS-Levels have been <em>decoupled</em> from A-Levels, and no longer count towards A-Levels. This has driven substantial decreases in entry numbers across subjects that have been reformed. In Wales and Northern Ireland, AS-Levels now count as 40% of the A-Level."

"In England, in 2017 the exams regulator, Ofqual, <a href='https://ffteducationdatalab.org.uk/2017/08/a-level-results-day-2017-a-look-at-changing-grade-distributions/'>instructed exam boards to increase the share of A-grades awarded in French, German and Spanish A-Levels by 1%, compared to what they would otherwise have awarded</a>. This was done to equalise what was considered to be overly harsh grading."
